## Key Themes Across Research

### 1. Paradigm Shift Validation
Nearly all papers confirm the fundamental transformation from manual coding to AI orchestration, with developers becoming AI directors rather than code writers.

### 2. Three-Phase Workflow Support
Multiple sources, particularly Harper Reed's practical workflow, validate the plan-review-implement methodology as an effective approach.

### 3. Productivity Evidence
Consistent evidence across industry and academic sources for significant productivity gains (25-40% range).

### 4. Quality and Trust Concerns
Research identifies important limitations:
- High rate of behavioral regressions in AI-generated fixes
- Significant drop in solve rates under rigorous auditing
- Need for strong quality assurance and human oversight

### 5. Role Transformation
Strong consensus on developer role evolution:
- From implementers to orchestrators
- From "how" to "what"
- From syntax experts to requirement architects
- Emergence of "intent engineers" terminology

### 6. SE 3.0 Concept
Multiple papers adopt the SE 3.0 framework:
- SE 1.0: Manual coding
- SE 2.0: AI-augmented development
- SE 3.0: Agentic software engineering with AI teammates

### 7. Current Limitations
Research provides realistic assessment:
- ~30-40% autonomous completion rate for complex tasks
- Significant verification and testing still required
- Human oversight remains critical for quality and security
