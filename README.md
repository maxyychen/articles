## The Journey of My LLM Experience

When I first encountered ChatGPT, I was amazed by its ability to communicate like a human. However, I quickly learned that not everything it says is correct. You should be careful when using LLMs. I share my experience in this article: [How to Use Generative AI: A Practical Guide](effective_ai_prompting_guide.md).

In early 2025, Claude Code appeared, which changed my workflow for building software. Since then, I think more but code less. If you want to avoid generating code that you cannot handle, read [Generative AI in Software Engineering: The Dawn of a New Era](generative_ai_in_software_engineering.md).

I've started thinking about how to leverage LLM agents to help my work in a trustworthy way. We can implement LLM agents using external tools to perform searches, database operations, external API calls, and more ([Agent, Tools, and MCP: Complete Data Flow Guide](agent_tools_dataflow.md)). We can even integrate multiple LLM agents into a multi-agent system to make our lives easier ([Multi-Agent AI Frameworks: Comprehensive Comparison (2025)](multi_agent_frameworks_comparison.md)).

Today, much related work in the healthcare industry has been reported, and many results show positive outcomes ([Multi-Agent LLM Healthcare Review Article](Multi-Agent_LLM_Healthcare_Review_Article.md)).

I work in the healthcare industry, and I will continue to dive deeper into this field and leverage state-of-the-art technology to provide clinicians with better tools for patient care.
