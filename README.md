## The Journey of My LLM Experience

When I first encountered ChatGPT, I was amazed by its ability to communicate like a human. However, I quickly learned that not everything it says is correctâ€”you need to be careful when using LLMs. I share my experience in this note: [How to Use Generative AI: A Practical Guide](effective_ai_prompting_guide.md).

In early 2025, Claude Code appeared, which changed my workflow for building software. Since then, I think more but code less. If you want to avoid generating code that you cannot handle, read [Generative AI in Software Engineering: The Dawn of a New Era](generative_ai_in_software_engineering.md).

I've started thinking about how to leverage LLM agents nad make it work in a reliable and trustworthy way. Today we can easily implement LLM agents who can using external tools to perform any tasks, such as searches, database operations, external API calls, and more ([Agent, Tools, and MCP: Complete Data Flow Guide](agent_tools_dataflow.md)). We can even integrate multiple LLM agents into a multi-agent system to make our lives easier ([Multi-Agent AI Frameworks: Comprehensive Comparison (2025)](multi_agent_frameworks_comparison.md)).

In the meantime, multi-agent systems have proven effective in many fields, such as building software with minimal human intervention (Devin, ChatDev), self-driving vehicles, scientific discovery, and healthcare.([Multi-Agent LLM Healthcare Review Article](Multi-Agent_LLM_Healthcare_Review_Article.md)).

Working at the intersection of AI and healthcare, I'm committed to developing intelligent tools that empower clinicians to deliver better patient care. This is where my journey continues.
