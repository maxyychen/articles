## The Journey of My LLM Experience

When I first encountered ChatGPT, I was amazed by its ability to communicate like a human. However, I quickly learned that not everything it says is correctâ€”you need to be careful when using LLMs. I share my experience in this note: [How to Use Generative AI to reduce hallucinations: A Practical Guide](effective_ai_prompting_guide.md).

In early 2025, Claude Code appeared, which changed my workflow for building software. Since then, I focus more on design and testing rather than writing code.[Generative AI in Software Engineering: The Dawn of a New Era](generative_ai_in_software_engineering.md).

I've started thinking about how to leverage LLM agents and make it work in a reliable and trustworthy way. Today we can easily implement LLM agents who can use external tools to perform complex tasks, such as searches, database operations, external API calls, and more ([Agent, Tools, and MCP: Complete Data Flow Guide](agent_tools_dataflow.md)). We can even integrate agents to undertake complex tasks. I've organized a comprehensive comparison covering both production SDKs from tech giants (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and open-source frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, etc.): [Multi-Agent AI Frameworks & SDKs: Comprehensive Comparison (2025)](multi_agent_frameworks_comparison.md).


In the meantime, multi-agent systems have proven effective in many fields, such as building software with minimal human intervention (Devin, ChatDev), self-driving vehicles, scientific discovery, and healthcare.([Multi-Agent LLM Healthcare Review Article](Multi-Agent_LLM_Healthcare_Review_Article.md)).

Working at the intersection of AI and healthcare, I'm committed to developing intelligent tools that empower clinicians to deliver better patient care. This is where my journey continues.

## Research Challenges and Future Directions

As multi-agent systems evolve, several critical challenges remain that drive my research interests:

### 1. Trust and Reliability
- How can we ensure multi-agent systems produce consistent, verifiable outputs?
- Developing mechanisms to detect and prevent hallucinations in agent-to-agent communication
- Building audit trails for agent decisions in high-stakes domains like healthcare

### 2. Coordination and Communication
- Optimizing agent collaboration without excessive inter-agent communication overhead
- Designing efficient protocols for agent consensus and conflict resolution
- Balancing autonomy with centralized coordination

### 3. Scalability and Performance
- Managing computational costs as the number of agents increases
- Efficient task decomposition and dynamic load balancing
- Minimizing latency in real-time multi-agent applications

### 4. Safety and Alignment
- Ensuring emergent behaviors align with human values and intentions
- Preventing adversarial agents from compromising system integrity
- Establishing safety boundaries for autonomous agent actions

### 5. Explainability and Transparency
- Making multi-agent decision-making processes interpretable to end users
- Tracking responsibility and accountability in distributed agent systems
- Visualizing complex agent interactions for debugging and validation


These challenges represent opportunities to push the boundaries of what multi-agent systems can achieve, particularly in healthcare where trust, safety, and explainability are paramount.
