## Core Design Principles

### 1. Agent Autonomy

- Each agent should be an independent entity capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting
- Agents make decisions based on their goals and environment without constant supervision
- Enable self-organization within defined boundaries

**Key Considerations:**
- Define agent boundaries and decision-making scope
- Balance autonomy with coordination requirements
- Implement proper error handling for autonomous decisions

### 2. Clear Role Definition

- Each agent should have a specific purpose and expertise
- Define capabilities, responsibilities, and boundaries for each agent
- Avoid overlapping responsibilities that create confusion

**Key Considerations:**
- Document agent roles and capabilities clearly
- Assign specialized tasks to specialized agents
- Prevent role ambiguity that leads to coordination issues

### 3. Effective Communication

- Establish clear protocols for agent interaction (message-passing, tool delegation, state sharing)
- Choose appropriate communication patterns based on task complexity
- Consider standardized protocols (A2A, MCP, ACP) for cross-framework compatibility

**Communication Methods:**
- **Message-passing**: Agents exchange structured messages (AG2, AutoGen)
- **Tool delegation**: Agents invoke each other as tools (CrewAI)
- **State routing**: Agents share state through graph transitions (LangGraph)
- **Event-driven**: Agents respond to events autonomously

### 4. State Management

- Decide between shared state (global context) vs. isolated state (agent-specific)
- Implement proper context passing between agents
- Maintain conversation history and memory when needed

**State Strategies:**
- **Shared state**: All agents access common memory (good for coordination)
- **Isolated state**: Each agent maintains own state (good for independence)
- **Hybrid state**: Combination of shared and isolated (most common)

### 5. Goal-Oriented Design

- Agents should work toward explicit, measurable objectives
- Break complex tasks into manageable sub-goals
- Enable feedback loops for continuous improvement

**Goal Definition:**
- Define clear success criteria for each agent
- Implement progress tracking and monitoring
- Enable agents to adapt based on feedback
