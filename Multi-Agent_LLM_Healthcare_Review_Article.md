## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence through their exceptional capabilities in language understanding, text generation, planning, reasoning, and knowledge integration [1]. These advances have catalyzed the development of LLM-based agents—autonomous systems capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions to achieve specific objectives [2]. In healthcare, LLM-based agents offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance clinical decision-making, streamline workflows, and improve patient outcomes.

Despite the impressive capabilities of single LLM agents, they face inherent limitations when confronting complex, multifaceted healthcare challenges. Single agents struggle with tasks requiring diverse expertise, handling multimodal data, maintaining long-term memory, and coordinating multiple perspectives—all critical requirements in modern clinical practice [3]. These limitations have driven the emergence of multi-agent systems, where multiple specialized agents collaborate to leverage collective intelligence and overcome individual agent constraints.

### 1.2 The Evolution of Multi-Agent Systems in Healthcare

Research interest in LLMs in healthcare has grown exponentially, with publications surging from a single study in 2019 to 557 in 2024, underscoring the expanding capabilities and clinical potential of these systems [4]. Multi-agent systems represent a natural evolution in this trajectory, inspired by how healthcare professionals collaborate in real-world clinical settings through Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) discussions, case conferences, and consultations [5].

The adoption of multi-agent frameworks facilitates dynamic and interactive diagnostic processes where agents discuss cases, challenge assumptions, and reach consensus—mirroring the collaborative nature of medical teams [6]. This paradigm shift from individual AI assistants to collaborative agent ecosystems promises to bridge the gap between LLM knowledge bases and practical clinical application.

## 2. Fundamentals of Multi-Agent LLM Systems

### 2.1 From LLMs to LLM-Based Agents

An **agent**, as defined in AI, perceives its environment and takes actions accordingly to achieve specific goals [2]. An **LLM-based agent** extends traditional LLMs by integrating:

- **External knowledge retrieval** (medical databases, clinical guidelines)
- **Task planning capabilities** (decomposition of complex medical cases)
- **Tool invocation** (medical calculators, diagnostic systems, EHR interfaces)
- **Structured decision-making** (evidence-based clinical reasoning)

Unlike standard LLMs that primarily process text, LLM-based agents operate autonomously, adapt dynamically to new information, and can execute actions in real-world healthcare environments [1].

### 2.2 The Multi-Agent Paradigm

A **multi-agent system** comprises multiple interacting agents that collaborate to accomplish tasks exceeding individual agent capabilities [7]. In healthcare contexts, multi-agent systems offer several advantages:

#### 2.2.1 Improved Task Accuracy
Complex medical problems can be decomposed into specialized sub-problems assigned to domain-expert agents. For example, in a diagnostic scenario, agents can assume roles analogous to radiologists, pathologists, primary care physicians, and specialists—each contributing domain-specific expertise [8].

#### 2.2.2 Enhanced Robustness
Agent collaboration mitigates individual agent failures and reduces the impact of errors. When one agent produces uncertain or potentially erroneous outputs, other agents can provide corrective feedback through peer review mechanisms [9].

#### 2.2.3 Increased Adaptability
Multi-agent systems can dynamically reassign tasks based on environmental changes, patient condition evolution, or new information availability. This flexibility enables responsive adaptation to clinical dynamics [7].

#### 2.2.4 Collective Intelligence
Agent collaboration fosters the exchange of diverse perspectives, generating collective intelligence that explores more innovative diagnostic and treatment solutions. Studies show that multi-agent discussions can increase diagnostic accuracy from 0% to 71.3% in cases involving cognitive biases [10].

### 2.3 Unique Considerations for Healthcare Applications

Deploying multi-agent LLM systems in healthcare requires addressing several critical factors [1]:

#### Multimodal Integration
Medical data spans text (clinical notes, literature), imaging (radiology, pathology), laboratory results, vital signs, and genomic data. Multi-agent systems must process and synthesize these diverse inputs for accurate clinical decision support.

#### Clinical Collaboration
Healthcare inherently involves interdisciplinary teamwork. Multi-agent systems should facilitate information sharing and human-AI collaboration while ensuring physicians maintain clinical oversight and final decision authority.

#### Accuracy and Reliability
Given the direct impact on patient outcomes, multi-agent systems must meet rigorous validation standards, minimize diagnostic errors, and provide evidence-based recommendations with appropriate uncertainty quantification.

#### Transparency and Traceability
Clinical decisions must be auditable and explainable to align with medical ethics, medicolegal requirements, and regulatory standards. Multi-agent systems should provide clear reasoning chains and evidence trails.

## 3. Multi-Agent System Architectures

### 3.1 Core Architectural Components

LLM-based multi-agent systems in healthcare comprise four primary architectural components [1]:

#### 3.1.1 System Profile
The profile defines agent role attributes, behavioral patterns, and operational competencies. Three main profile paradigms exist:

**Functional Modularization**: Structures the system into specialized functional modules (data analysis, diagnostic reasoning, treatment planning), each responsible for distinct tasks. The MEGDA system implements function-driven profiles with explicit task assignments and workflows [1].

**Role Specialization**: Assigns agents to specific clinical functions mirroring real-world medical roles (diagnosis, medical imaging, treatment planning, surgical assistance). These agents incorporate domain-specific knowledge and interact with healthcare systems for imaging analysis and interdisciplinary coordination [1].

**Departmental Organization**: Structures agents based on medical disciplines (cardiology, hematology, oncology), establishing domain-specific knowledge boundaries. Agents rely on specialized disease knowledge graphs and dynamic collaboration mechanisms for interdisciplinary consultations [1].

#### 3.1.2 Clinical Planning
Clinical planning decomposes complex medical tasks into manageable subtasks, enabling efficient problem-solving through structured workflows [1]:

**Task Decomposition**: Follows structured decomposition from high-level objectives to specific actions. Sequential Task Chain approaches structure planning into distinct steps (data ingestion, hypothesis generation, treatment planning, risk assessment), each interacting with specialized medical tools [1].

**Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Collaborative Experts models assign specialized agents to clinical areas (radiology, pathology, laboratory analysis). Agents communicate using standardized protocols to aggregate findings and refine diagnoses, reducing diagnostic uncertainty through integrated multi-specialty insights [1].

**Adaptive Planning**: Dynamic frameworks adjust decision-making based on real-time data and task complexity. The MDAgents framework employs LLMs with predefined medical roles functioning autonomously or in coordination. Planning layers continuously update clinical strategies, prioritize urgent cases, and refine decisions based on new evidence [1].

**Iterative Self-Evolution**: Systems maintain experience bases of past cases, refining decision-making over time. Self-improvement mechanisms allow agents to autonomously incorporate new medical data and learn from previous outcomes, progressively enhancing accuracy [1].

#### 3.1.3 Medical Reasoning
The reasoning module enhances diagnostic accuracy through structured logical inference:

**Multi-Step Diagnostic Reasoning**: Chain-of-Thought methods generate step-by-step reasoning, while Tree-of-Thought approaches explore multiple hypotheses in parallel, discarding less probable options [1].

**Reflective Decision-Making**: Systems iteratively refine conclusions by incorporating real-time feedback and expert input. Inspired by the ReAct framework, they alternate between reasoning and action, identifying inconsistencies and improving robustness [1].

**Collaborative Group Reasoning**: Multi-agent reasoning frameworks assign specialized agents to perform independent analyses. Conclusions are aggregated through consensus mechanisms, mitigating individual biases and enhancing reliability [1].

**Memory-Enhanced Reasoning**: Long-term memory modules enable agents to accumulate medical knowledge and clinical experiences, refining decision-making over time and maintaining continuity in patient care [1].

#### 3.1.4 External Capacity Enhancement
This component augments agent capabilities through integration with clinical data sources and tools [1]:

**Perception Subsystem**: Processes diverse clinical inputs including structured EHRs, medical images (via models like CLIP), and scanned documents (via OCR), facilitating comprehensive multimodal understanding.

**Knowledge Integration**: Connects agents with medical knowledge graphs, drug interaction databases, clinical guideline repositories, and biomedical literature, enabling verification of inferences with trusted sources.

**Action Layer**: Enables agents to perform clinical tasks using specialized tools (medical calculators, EHR interfaces, image analysis software), ensuring outputs are contextually appropriate and evidence-based.

### 3.2 Communication Paradigms

Multi-agent systems employ various communication patterns [7]:

**Cooperative Communication**: Agents work synergistically toward shared objectives, sharing information and resources. This paradigm suits diagnostic consensus-building and treatment planning.

**Argumentative Communication**: Agents engage in structured debates, challenging each other's conclusions to refine diagnostic accuracy. This mirrors clinical case conferences and peer review processes.

**Competitive Communication**: Agents propose competing hypotheses or treatment strategies, with selection based on evidence strength and predictive accuracy. This paradigm can identify optimal approaches in uncertain scenarios.

### 3.3 Communication Structures

The organizational topology of agent interactions significantly impacts system performance [7]:

**Hierarchical Communication**: Establishes supervisor-subordinate relationships. Supervisor agents coordinate discussions, synthesize conclusions, and determine consensus achievement. The MAC framework exemplifies this structure with doctor agents overseen by a supervisor agent [5].

**Decentralized Communication**: Agents communicate peer-to-peer without central coordination. This structure offers robustness and scalability but may face coordination challenges.

**Centralized Communication**: All agents communicate through a central hub that aggregates information and distributes decisions. This simplifies coordination but creates potential bottlenecks.

**Shared Message Pools**: Agents access common information repositories, enabling asynchronous communication and persistent knowledge sharing across consultation sessions.

The MAC framework, published in *npj Digital Medicine* (2025), represents a landmark achievement in multi-agent diagnostic systems [5]. Inspired by clinical MDT discussions, MAC orchestrates multiple doctor agents and a supervisor agent to collaboratively diagnose diseases through structured conversations.

**Methodology**: Tested on 302 rare disease cases from 33 disease categories, MAC was evaluated in two clinical scenarios:
- **Primary consultation**: Limited patient information, simulating initial clinical encounters
- **Follow-up consultation**: Complete diagnostic test results available

**Performance Results**:
- **Primary Consultation** (4 doctor agents + supervisor, GPT-4):
  - Most likely diagnosis accuracy: 34.11% (vs. 19.65% for standalone GPT-4)
  - Possible diagnoses accuracy: 48.12% (vs. 34.55% for GPT-4)
  - Further diagnostic tests helpful rate: 78.26% (vs. 58.17% for GPT-4)

- **Follow-up Consultation** (4 doctor agents + supervisor, GPT-4):
  - Most likely diagnosis accuracy: 53.86% (vs. 37.86% for GPT-4)
  - Possible diagnoses accuracy: 67.88% (vs. 59.71% for GPT-4)

MAC achieved a **74% relative improvement** over single GPT-4 in primary consultation most likely diagnosis accuracy [5].

**Key Findings**:
1. **Optimal Configuration**: Four doctor agents with one supervisor agent produced best performance
2. **Base Model Importance**: GPT-4 as base model significantly outperformed GPT-3.5
3. **Supervisor Role**: Supervisor agent presence significantly enhanced effectiveness, moderating discussions and eliciting diverse opinions
4. **Specialty Assignment**: Assigning specific specialties to doctor agents did not significantly improve performance, suggesting limitations in current models' domain-specific capabilities [5]

**Clinical Impact**: MAC demonstrated ability to identify underlying disease causes that single models missed. For example, while GPT-4 diagnosed "recurrent pericarditis," MAC correctly identified "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome" as the underlying cause [5].

#### 4.1.2 Mitigating Cognitive Biases
A simulation study published in *Journal of Medical Internet Research* (2024) evaluated multi-agent systems for reducing cognitive biases in clinical decision-making [10]. In cases where cognitive biases resulted in misdiagnoses:

**Key Finding**: MAC consistently produced the highest output tokens, allowing exploration of diverse reasoning paths and reflection on previous outputs. However, increasing output tokens alone (by extending conversation rounds) showed diminishing returns, suggesting that multi-agent *interaction* rather than mere volume drives performance gains [5].

### 5.4 Reliability and Consistency

The MAC framework demonstrated high reliability across repeated testing [5]:
- **Fleiss' kappa analysis**: Moderate agreement (>0.4) in 23 out of 28 evaluations
- Minimal performance variation across testing rounds
- Consistent superiority over single-agent baselines

This reliability is critical for clinical deployment, where inconsistent system behavior would undermine clinician trust and patient safety.

### 5.5 Cost Analysis

Practical deployment requires cost consideration. The MAC study reported [5]:
- **Primary consultation**: $0.12 USD per case (GPT-4 base model)
- **Follow-up consultation**: $0.17 USD per case (GPT-4 base model)

These costs are substantially lower than GPT-3.5 alternatives for equivalent performance, suggesting that using more capable base models in multi-agent configurations offers better cost-effectiveness than using weaker models in simpler architectures.

## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 The Gap Between Knowledge and Clinical Application

A significant gap exists between LLMs' extensive knowledge bases and their clinical diagnostic capabilities [5]. This disparity stems from several factors:

#### 8.1.1 Medical Reasoning Limitations
Robust medical reasoning requires more than factual knowledge—it demands hypothesis generation, evidence weighing, differential diagnosis construction, and iterative refinement based on new information. Recent studies raise questions about LLMs' reasoning abilities in complex scenarios [5].

#### 8.1.2 Training Data Characteristics
LLM training materials are primarily structured in question-answer formats focused on general medical knowledge. This approach fails to provide training in specialized domains and does not sufficiently incorporate actual clinical practice dynamics [5].

#### 8.1.3 Rare Disease Data Scarcity
Given the vast number of rare diseases, their low incidence rates, and limited case reporting, creating comprehensive training databases for rare disease management remains challenging [5]. This data scarcity particularly impacts single-agent performance, making multi-agent collaboration especially valuable for rare disease diagnosis.

### 8.2 Why Multi-Agent Systems Outperform Single Agents

Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates multi-agent superiority, but understanding the mechanisms driving this advantage is crucial:

#### 8.2.1 Diverse Perspectives
Multiple agents explore different reasoning paths, reducing the likelihood of overlooking critical diagnostic possibilities. This mirrors the value of clinical case conferences where diverse perspectives identify diagnoses individual clinicians might miss [5].

#### 8.2.2 Error Correction Through Disagreement
When agents disagree, they challenge each other's assumptions and reasoning, leading to more thorough evaluation of evidence. This argumentative process identifies logical errors and factual inaccuracies [9,10].

#### 8.2.3 Depth of Analysis
Multi-agent conversations generate significantly more output tokens than single-agent responses, allowing exploration of complex reasoning chains [5]. However, this benefit derives from interactive reasoning rather than simply generating longer responses—extending single-agent outputs shows diminishing returns [5].

#### 8.2.4 Specialization Benefits
When agents are assigned roles or domains, they can provide depth in specific areas while benefiting from others' complementary expertise. However, current models show limited benefit from explicit specialty assignment, suggesting that base model capabilities remain insufficient for true expert-level specialization [5].

### 8.3 Comparison with Alternative Approaches

Multi-agent systems outperformed alternative prompting strategies (Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, Self-Refine) in the MAC study [5]. This superiority stems from:

**Interactive Refinement**: Unlike self-refine approaches where a single model critiques its own outputs, multi-agent systems benefit from genuinely diverse perspectives challenging assumptions.

**Parallel Exploration**: Unlike chain-of-thought sequential reasoning, multi-agent systems explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously through different agents.

**Consensus Building**: Self-consistency samples multiple reasoning paths from the same model, while multi-agent systems synthesize truly different agent viewpoints.

### 8.4 The Path to Clinical Deployment

Despite promising results, significant work remains before multi-agent LLM systems achieve widespread clinical deployment:

#### 8.4.1 Validation Requirements
Rigorous clinical validation studies must demonstrate:
- Safety and effectiveness in real patient populations
- Non-inferiority or superiority to standard care
- Consistent performance across demographic groups
- Appropriate behavior in edge cases and adversarial scenarios

#### 8.4.2 Integration Challenges
Successful deployment requires:
- Seamless EHR integration
- Minimal workflow disruption
- Acceptable latency for clinical decision support
- User interfaces supporting efficient clinician-agent interaction

#### 8.4.3 Regulatory Pathways
Navigating regulatory approval processes requires:
- Classification of systems as medical devices or decision support tools
- Demonstration of safety and effectiveness
- Post-market surveillance plans
- Protocols for managing model updates

#### 8.4.4 Adoption Factors
Clinical adoption depends on:
- Demonstrated value in clinician workflows
- Positive impact on patient outcomes
- Acceptable cost-benefit profiles
- Alignment with organizational priorities

### 8.5 Ethical Considerations in Context

The ethical challenges identified (bias, privacy, responsibility) are not unique to multi-agent systems but are amplified by system complexity:

**Complexity and Opacity**: Multi-agent interactions create reasoning chains more difficult to audit than single-agent outputs, potentially obscuring the sources of errors or biases.

**Distributed Responsibility**: When multiple agents contribute to recommendations, attributing responsibility for errors becomes less straightforward, complicating accountability frameworks.

**Emergent Behaviors**: Agent interactions may produce unexpected emergent behaviors not present in individual agents, requiring comprehensive testing and monitoring.

These considerations necessitate careful system design, rigorous validation, and thoughtful governance frameworks.

## 9. Conclusion

Multi-agent Large Language Model systems represent a paradigm shift in healthcare artificial intelligence, moving from individual AI assistants to collaborative agent ecosystems that mirror the interdisciplinary nature of clinical practice. This review has synthesized evidence from over 60 studies published from 2022-2025, revealing significant progress in architectures, applications, and performance validation.

### 9.1 Key Findings

**Performance Superiority**: Multi-agent systems consistently outperform single-agent models across diverse healthcare tasks, with improvements ranging from 42-74% in diagnostic accuracy tasks [5,10]. The Multi-Agent Conversation (MAC) framework's achievement of 53.86% diagnostic accuracy on rare diseases—compared to 37.86% for standalone GPT-4—demonstrates the substantial clinical value of agent collaboration [5].

**Architectural Diversity**: Multi-agent systems employ varied architectures (hierarchical, decentralized, centralized) and communication paradigms (cooperative, argumentative, competitive) tailored to specific clinical applications [1,7]. The optimal configuration depends on task characteristics, with hierarchical structures showing advantages for complex diagnostic reasoning [5].

**Broad Applicability**: Multi-agent LLM systems have demonstrated value across disease diagnosis, clinical decision support, data analytics, medical education, and healthcare service optimization. Notable implementations include diagnostic consensus systems, cognitive bias mitigation frameworks, multimodal diagnostic platforms, and simulation-based training environments [1,5,10,11,12,15].

**Mechanism of Superiority**: Multi-agent systems outperform single agents through diverse perspective integration, error correction via disagreement, deeper analytical exploration, and collective intelligence emergence [5,9,10]. These benefits derive from genuine agent interaction rather than simply generating more output [5].

### 9.2 Remaining Challenges

Despite impressive advances, significant barriers constrain clinical deployment:

**Technical Limitations**: Hallucination management, multimodal integration, system scalability, and real-time performance requirements remain incompletely solved [1,7,16,17].

**Evaluation Gaps**: Current benchmarks inadequately assess real-world clinical performance, and the gap between benchmark success and clinical utility persists [1,4,18].

**Implementation Barriers**: System integration complexity, resource requirements, and workflow disruption create practical obstacles to adoption [1].

**Ethical Concerns**: Algorithmic bias, privacy vulnerabilities, unclear liability frameworks, and insufficient patient-centered design require attention [1].

### 9.3 Future Outlook

The trajectory of multi-agent LLM systems in healthcare appears promising, with several key development directions:

**Enhanced Reasoning**: Integration of advances like DeepSeek R1's reinforcement learning-based reasoning and inference-time scaling will improve complex medical decision-making capabilities [1].

**Physical Integration**: Extension to robotic systems enabling direct patient care represents a significant frontier, pending resolution of safety and reliability challenges [1].

**Advanced Training**: Sophisticated simulation environments and autonomous agent evolution through synthetic case experience will accelerate system development [1].

**Human-AI Collaboration**: Optimal outcomes likely require hybrid intelligence models where agents augment rather than replace human clinicians, combining AI's information processing capabilities with human judgment, empathy, and contextual understanding [19].

### 9.4 Path Forward

Realizing the full potential of multi-agent LLM systems in healthcare requires coordinated efforts across multiple domains:

**Research Priorities**:
- Developing more robust hallucination detection and mitigation mechanisms

- Investigating optimal human-AI collaboration models
- Advancing privacy-preserving multi-agent architectures

**Clinical Validation**:
- Conducting rigorous prospective clinical trials
- Establishing performance benchmarks for clinical deployment
- Developing real-world effectiveness monitoring systems
- Creating safety surveillance frameworks

**Regulatory Evolution**:
- Defining validation standards for multi-agent medical systems
- Establishing liability and responsibility frameworks
- Creating protocols for managing deployed system updates
- Developing transparency and explainability requirements

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
- Involving patients and caregivers in system design
- Training clinicians in effective human-agent collaboration
- Addressing concerns about job displacement and deskilling
- Building public trust through transparent communication

### 9.5 Final Perspective

Multi-agent LLM systems should be viewed as **collaborative partners** augmenting clinical decision-making rather than autonomous replacements for healthcare professionals [5]. Their value lies in handling information processing tasks that exceed human cognitive capacity while humans provide contextual judgment, ethical reasoning, empathetic communication, and ultimate clinical responsibility.

The question is not whether multi-agent systems will transform healthcare, but how rapidly we can address remaining challenges to enable their safe, effective, and equitable deployment. The progress from 2022-2025 has been remarkable; the next phase must focus on translating research advances into clinical impact that improves patient outcomes, enhances clinician capabilities, and advances global health equity.

As LLM technology continues to evolve, multi-agent systems are positioned to play an increasingly central role in addressing healthcare's most pressing challenges: improving diagnostic accuracy, enhancing access to expert-level care, reducing clinician burnout, and personalizing treatment for diverse patient populations. Achieving these goals requires continued interdisciplinary collaboration among AI researchers, clinicians, ethicists, regulators, and patients—mirroring the multi-agent collaboration these systems are designed to emulate.
